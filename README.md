# DevKit

A personal grab-bag of browser-based tools I actually use while building products. Everything runs client-side — no data leaves your machine.

Built with Nuxt 4, Vue 3, Vuetify, and Tailwind CSS.

## What's inside

**Notes**
- **Paint** — a simple canvas for sketching ideas, with brush tools, color palettes, and session saving via IndexedDB
- **Markdown** — live preview editor with syntax highlighting and mermaid diagram rendering

**Converters**
- **Cron** — paste a cron expression and instantly see when it fires next (includes common presets)
- **Timestamp** — convert between Unix timestamps and human-readable dates, with timezone support
- **Base64** — encode/decode text to and from Base64
- **Color** — convert between HEX, RGB, HSL, CMYK and generate palettes from any input

**Graphics**
- **Image Resizer** — drag-drop an image, pick dimensions or a scale factor, download the result
- **Image Compressor** — squeeze file sizes down with adjustable quality presets

**Text Utilities**
- **Regex Tester** — test patterns with real-time highlighting, match counts, and flag toggles

**Random**
- **UUID** — create uuid, ulid etc. on client-side.
